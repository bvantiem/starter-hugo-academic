I mostly work on prisons, with a focus on how prison conditions and policies affect in-prison and post-release outcomes. I am currently working on projects related to prison climate, and the impact of prison-based programming on post-release employment. I am also interested in the overlap between systems of crime and immigration control, and have published on the impact of a local-federal immigration enforcement partnership on police behavior. 

Starting in September 2024, I will be a SSRC Criminal Justice Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow. I received my Ph.D. in Criminology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2024. I am currently a member of the Scandinavian Prison Project's Research Team. I previously managed a large scale peer support program in prisons in the UK and Ireland. I also served as an independent monitor of two immigration removal centers.
